# Project Description
Our project aims to provide a simple reaction based experience in the form of a simple Piano Tiles inspired rhythm game for browsers. Users can select from a variety of songs to play, where they will be taken to a loading screen to wait for the game to load. Upon loading, tiles will begin to slide down one of 4 lanes in quick succession, and the user has to press one of the binded keys below a marked threshold line near the bottom of the screen to register note hits. The accuracy of the note timing will be taken into consideration for scores, and too many misses or poorly timed hits will lead to a game over. Scores are not saved, but if the user is logged into an existing account, their highscore will automatically update accordingly. Users can view their own high score in the leaderboard page, along with the names and score of the users with the highest scores for that song.

API KEY STATUS: TBD
